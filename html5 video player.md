What is an Online Video Player?
HTML5 Video Player is a library of JavaScript that builds controls over top of the HTML5 video element. This provides a uniform look between different browsers.

HTML5 online video players allow you to play videos directly in a web browser without the use of additional plugins. Some time ago, we installed a Flash player to stream videos. But, HTML5 video players offer an easy way to integrate native video players on your website. While you can still embed YouTube videos, here’s a more handy way to showcase videos to your visitors, whether you are a personal trainer creating exercise demo videos or an influencer making a funny video.

HTML5 video players only need you to use the video element. Set the width and height for the video size and control attributes to add functions such as play and pause or set up the video to play automatically.

Most sophisticated browsers now support HTML5 videos, so online video playing is now more comfortable both on desktop and mobile screens.

Should you go with a propriety media player or one that’s open-source and free?



Open-Source Online video player vs Propriety media player
Open source players offer some degree of advantage over those you need to purchase licenses from.

Cost
Open-source html5 video players are free for you to use. You can even evaluate and review their source code.

Propriety media players often come at a premium price. But you’d get a lot of options of features and integrations which would otherwise take considerable development cost on your end.

Bugs
Popular open-source solutions tend to have fewer bugs and faster fixes because of the community support they come with.

For propriety solutions you can reach out to the team concerned and let them fix the problem for you. This is why before choosing a propriety solution you should check if they have a good customer support.

Customization
Open-source products have a high potential for customization. Almost everything you see is customizable, so the tool can be tailored to meet your unique needs. You get access to free and instant support from a global community of developers and enthusiasts who are more than happy to assist the users of their solution.

For propriety media players, you may not get much control over the customization as you’re buying the finished product. But these often come preloaded with features and themes which will make it much easier to tinker with.

Support
With Open-source html5 video players you get proper documentation, wikis, newsgroups, email lists, and well as an option for a live chat whenever you face a glitch.

With propriety media players you get the support of the team you bought the services from. They’ll take care of your issues without the hassle of going through multiple documentation, videos, etc. This is ideal for people who are not tech-savvy or have low bandwidth.
